20 Frog ideas

4. The frog is now evil (the frog becomes evil by having sinister black and red eyes and he continues to eat the flies)
5. The flies can change pace (the flies all have different speeds) 
6. The flies move in weird ways (the flies move in weird ways making it harder for the frog  to eat them)
