### Frog heaven 
As you croak in the middle of your swamp habitat, your life flashes before your little frog eyes. You see the life that you’ve lived peacefully, joyfully, and not breaking any of the 10 frogments shows the kind of frog that you were. As you slowly feel yourself fleeing from this mortal plane, you close your eyes and reopen them to see yourself in front of a gate; it’s different; it's shiny, pearly and calming, as you enter the gate you realize that you are in heaven a deity unknown in presence but known in your heart explains how you have arrived to paradise all your frog dreams will come true. As flies fly toward your tongue instead of flying away from your tongue, you realize that after so long, you’ve reached your final resting place, doing what pleases you for as long as you dream  

### Regular Frog
You're a regular frog in a regular swamp, catching flies to survive and avoiding predators. So far, everything is going well, and you haven’t done anything inherently bad; you’re just trying to survive like everyone else. The circle of life continues every day is the same: eat flies, avoid predators, feel the swampy air on your moist frog skin. Swim, and relax while you have the chance, life is going on every day, see what you can do to do your best.

### Pumpkin Smasher

You’re a mischievous frog doing some Halloween shenanigans, and you decide to SMASH some PUMPKINS. As you go around smashing the pumpkins, you realize how fun it truly is, and you feel something within something sinister. Is this the beginning of your heinous acts? First, it starts with pumpkin smashing, then breaking the 10 frogments, then Frog murder
