## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> **New Year New "code"** 
>> * contains some code that I made during my college semester.*

> The controls for this project are moving the mouse. Once you move the mouse, you will be able to control the brightly coloured circle 

> move your brightly coloured circle from the black background towards black square having your trail fade away once it enters and fade back in once it exits 

## Screenshot(s)

This bit should have some images of the program running so that the reader has a sense of what it looks like. For example:
