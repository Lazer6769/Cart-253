Kerven’s mod jam was a unique experience. When I played his game, I had an enjoyable time. The game was simple, but the idea of it was addictive to play. Having a frog attack another frog was interesting. The gameplay was fun, trying to avoid this massive frog was crazy, seeing how long I or someone else could avoid the sinister killer frog was intense, and the jumpscare that happened when you got caught was unexpected. It spooked me at first, but seeing it over and over was humorous. What I liked the most was watching the others play the game and seeing their reaction as they got jumpscared by the frog. It was especially funny when I was looking at other mod jams, and I would hear someone scream in fear from the scary frog. Kerven’s game was just an enjoyable experience that everyone got to try out and laugh from joy. Great game, awesome live reactions.

Scarlet’s game was compelling to play. The game was simple, but once you played it, you had to beat it. When I played her game, I was immediately hooked. The music reminded me of the first robot to sing "The Daisy Bell." The gameplay was simple but addictive, and I HAD TO WIN. I was always close to winning, but made a dumb mistake which cost me my chance to win. I couldn't stop until I won, and when I eventually did win the game I was overjoyed with excitement that i finally got to beat the game after so many attempts, and i gotta say it was a one of a kind experience, the ending was amazing. Have a gif of play of a frog winning and say You are the frog was immaculate. I'm glad to experience such a great game. And I can't wait to see what else she makes.

Alexander’s game is by far the hardest game I have ever played during the Mod Jam. To even have a chance at playing the game for a longer time then 5 seconds you have to multi task when playing his game for starters you have to make sure that the frog doesn't go off screen or else you lose to do this you have to use the mouse to push him back away the second task is to use the WASD keys to make sure the frog doesn't fall which is harder then it looks and the third which is more like a bonus is to eat the flies which is as equally hard as the rest since trying to do all three results in you dying constantly however, even though it’s hard once you do manage actually play the game its fun and rewarding great game, such a rage inducing experience.
