            <h3>What do these songs invoke </h3>
            <p>For me anyway the songs that are listed on the next page, have their own effect on me, some may inovke a
                nice calm timid nature, while others may express more energy, more intensity but allowing for it to be
                played in the background uninterrupting while working on an assignment.
            </p>



            <h3>Why these songs specifically</h3>
            <p>
                even though i did put these songs here, these aren't songs i play on loop, I do have another song list
                but wanted to go in a different directions, include songs that I like but don't listen to them often.
            </p>
