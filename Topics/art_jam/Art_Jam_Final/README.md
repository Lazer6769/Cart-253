## Description

> This program allows you to change the colors of the character you, 

> you can change the skin, irises, nose, and body color of the subject with the sliders

> as well as having the ability to draw anywhere on the screen except for on the character itself
> and you can even clear the drawings to restart it 

> and you can PICK COLORS

Also, for code I had never used before, I had never used both the color picker and the clear drawing features. First time using those  

## Screenshot(s)

This screenshot is just showing what you can do with the colors and the drawing function:
